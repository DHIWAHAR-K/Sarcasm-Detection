# Sarcasm-Detection
The Sarcasm Detection in Python script demonstrates sarcasm detection using a natural language processing approach with the nltk library. Users can input sentences, and the script predicts whether the sentences are sarcastic or not. The script serves as a foundational guide for sarcasm detection in Python.
