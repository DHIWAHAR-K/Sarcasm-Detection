# Sarcasm Detection in Python

## Overview

This Python script demonstrates the basics of sarcasm detection using a natural language processing (NLP) approach. The provided script utilizes the `nltk` library and a dataset containing sarcastic and non-sarcastic sentences. Explore this script to understand the fundamentals of sarcasm detection in Python.

## Script Components

- **Library Installation:** Installing the necessary libraries (`nltk` and others if required).
- **Dataset Loading:** Loading a dataset containing sarcastic and non-sarcastic sentences.
- **Text Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the text data for sarcasm detection.
- **NLP Model Training:** Utilizing the `nltk` library or other NLP techniques to train a sarcasm detection model.
- **User Input:** Code for user input to provide sentences for sarcasm detection.
- **Output Display:** Displaying the sarcasm prediction for user-input sentences.

## Running the Script

1. Install the required libraries by running `pip install nltk` in your Python environment.
2. Open and run the Python script (`sarcasm_detection.py`) in a Python environment.
3. The script will load the dataset, train the sarcasm detection model, and prompt for user input.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to input sentences for sarcasm detection.

## Customization

- Replace the dataset with your own sarcasm and non-sarcasm labeled sentences for specific detection.
- Experiment with different NLP techniques or machine learning models for sarcasm detection.
- Modify the script to include additional features or visualizations.
